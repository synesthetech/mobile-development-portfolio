# Event Management Mobile Application
## Purpose
This Android Java application allows the user to manage events through addition, editing, and deletion. 
Project for end of 8-week mobile app development class in Android / Java.
## Usage & Installation
Download the folder and open it in Android Studio to run the application.
## Notes
Built at beginning of SWE learnings, but this code definitely has much room for improvement in modularity. Many of the settings for each component can be made into an overall function to handle each type of case modeling to manage distinct elements in the app.
